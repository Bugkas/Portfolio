Project Title: Jericho Boado | Logic & Backend Portfolio 
Student Name: Jericho Boado
  
1. Topic Choice 

I chose to focus my portfolio on "Logic and Backend Development." As a Computer Science student, I am passionate about the internal structure and "engine" of applications rather than just the visual exterior. This portfolio highlights my journey from learning Python to building functional IoT and mobile systems, showcasing my focus on clean code and efficient system architecture.

2. Key Design Decisions

Color Palette: I utilized a "Midnight Blue" professional theme (#003366) to convey stability and technical authority.
Typography: I paired 'Segoe UI' for readability in body text with 'Consolas' for headings to provide a distinct "programmer" or "IDE" aesthetic.
Navigation: I implemented a sticky header to ensure the navigation menu is always accessible, along with an active page indicator to improve user orientation.
User Experience: I utilized scroll-margin-top in the CSS to ensure that anchor links (like the one leading to the Dev Resources table) do not get obscured by the sticky header.
Responsiveness: I used a mobile-first approach with CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure the site layout remains functional on smaller screens.

3. Form Structure

Contact Form (contact.html): Designed for simplicity, using standard text inputs, an email field with a placeholder to guide the user, and a textarea for detailed messages.
Registration Form (register.html): Structured to collect diverse data types using HTML5 inputs, including a date picker for Date of Birth, radio buttons for skill level selection, and a checkbox for legal/terms agreement.
Styling: Both forms are centered and styled with consistent padding, border-radius, and hover transitions on buttons to provide a modern, interactive feel.
